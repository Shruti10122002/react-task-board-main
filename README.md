I recently built a Real-Time Collaborative Task Board using React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and a Node.js backend. It allows multiple users to manage tasks in columns like To Do, In Progress, and Done — with live updates using Socket.io. I implemented drag-and-drop functionality, task editing awareness, and user presence indicators. The app is structured modularly for scalability and runs smoothly in real-time with seamless collaboration support.
